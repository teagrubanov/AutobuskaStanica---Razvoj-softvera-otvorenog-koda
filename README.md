Hi everyone!
This is my project for academic studies.
Name in English "Buss Station".
I was working on this project for a long time since I am a student and I am still learning IT things.
I hope it will help you in your future.
The project in done using Visual Studio and SMMSQL.
I wrote clear database query which you can execute step by step to get your full database.
Visual Studio app design in pretty minimalistic cause I like it that way, but If you don't like black and white design, you can always change it.
The thing you will probably have to change is connection string in every .cs in Visual Studio, If you want it to work for you.
This was my hardest project since I was studing, but I hope it will help someone like me, cause I had no help like this, so maybe someone find it. If you do, good luck!
Why it was the hardest project? Cause after four years of barely knowing anything, you have to put all you learned into one and make it work.
Plus, I never really understood how GitHub works, but this is also part of the project. 
Btw, in Visual Studio you will find Git -> Clone Repository... and then you can commit more files, like I did with Query.
I am gonna tell you one more, but most important thing!
USE GOOGLE FOR ANY QUESTION, ANY ERROR, ANY DEAD END while doing any project. LEARN TO GOOGLE.
